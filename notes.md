Ok - theme announced:

##You are the monstor!

So, changing my idea now.

All below is still what I am doing:

It will be like a tower defense mixed with a dungeon cawl.

You are the monstor in a dungeon

You have to place monsters and traps before the hero comes in

Hero has A* pathfinding





Using Pygame

Overall structure of the game is a dungeon crawl - always wanted to do one - PLUS -
  I want to use the code for our story engine.
