New game

Didn't like where the other one was going.

will make this one simple -

Small map
  Enemies come in - pathfinding

  As they find (encounter) treasure or player - they 'write' about it before they attack or take


Render level (from one map)
Spawn treasure (look for an empty spot)

On update - move enemies towards player and / treasure
